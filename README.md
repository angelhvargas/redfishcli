## Installation

### From Source

To install `redfishcli` from source, ensure you have Go installed on your system, then run:

```sh
go get github.com/angelhvargas/redfishcli
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/angelhvargas/redfishcli
go install
```

## Using Precompiled Binaries

Precompiled binaries for various platforms are available on the releases page. Download the binary for your platform, extract it, and place it in a directory included in your system's PATH.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### Scan RAID Health

Scan the RAID health of a server:

```bash
redfishcli storage raid health --drives -t [controller-type] -u [username] -p [password] -n [hostname]
```

- -t: Controller type (idrac or xclarity).

- -u: Username for the BMC.

- -p: Password for the BMC.

- -n: Hostname or IP address of the server.

## Example Usage

 Scan the RAID health of a Dell server with iDRAC:

```sh
redfishcli storage raid health --drives -t idrac -u root -p "your_password" -n 192.168.1.100 | jq
```

Scan the RAID health of a Lenovo server with XClarity:

```sh
redfishcli storage raid health --drives -t xclarity -u admin -p "your_password" -n 192.168.1.101 | jq
```

## Configuration

### Configuration File

You can create a configuration file to scan multiple servers without providing login parameters each time. By default, redfishcli looks for a configuration file at ~/.redfishcli/config.yaml.

#### Example Configuration (config.yaml)

```yaml
servers:
  - type: "idrac"
    hostname: "192.168.1.100"
    username: "root"
    password: "your_password"
  - type: "xclarity"
    hostname: "192.168.1.101"
    username: "admin"
    password: "your_password"

# Add more servers as needed
```


## Using the Configuration File

To use the configuration file, simply run:

```bash
redfishcli storage raid health --drives
```

`redfishcli` will automatically load the servers listed in the configuration file and scan their health.
